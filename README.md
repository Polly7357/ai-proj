- Sure, here's an outline for your initial function along with some example content:

### 1. Electricity Usage Estimation

**Content:**
This section allows users to input information about their household appliances and calculates daily electricity consumption, monthly electricity usage, and estimates electricity costs based on different pricing structures.

#### 1.1. Input Household Appliances
Users can input details about their household appliances, including power consumption in watts (W) and daily usage hours.

#### 1.2. Daily and Monthly Electricity Consumption
The function calculates the daily and monthly electricity consumption based on the user's input.

#### 1.3. Time-of-Use Pricing Estimates
- **Two-Tier Pricing**: Calculate estimated electricity costs based on a two-tier pricing structure.
- **Three-Tier Pricing**: Calculate estimated electricity costs based on a three-tier pricing structure.
- **Two-Tier Summer Pricing**: Calculate estimated electricity costs based on a two-tier pricing structure for the summer season.
- **Three-Tier Summer Pricing**: Calculate estimated electricity costs based on a three-tier pricing structure for the summer season.

#### 1.4. Progressive Pricing Estimates
- **Input Bill Amount**: Users can input their electricity bill amount to estimate their electricity usage.
- **Input Electricity Usage**: Users can input their electricity usage to estimate their electricity costs.

#### 1.5. Energy Saving Recommendations
Provide energy-saving recommendations based on the user's electricity usage and pricing options. These recommendations can help users evaluate the best pricing structure for their needs.

### 2. Carbon Footprint Estimation

**Content:**
This section allows users to input information about their daily consumption of various goods and services (food, clothing, housing, transportation) to estimate their carbon footprint (CDE - Carbon Dioxide Equivalent).

### 3. Management of Tariff Tables

**Content:**
This section helps Admins to manage electricity tariff tables and time-of-use rates.

- Admin can add, edit, or delete tariff tables.
- Each tariff table includes information about pricing tiers, peak/off-peak hours, and seasonal rates (if applicable).

#### 3.2. Time-of-Use Rate Management
- Admin can manage different time-of-use rate schedules, including regular and seasonal rates.

### 4. Real-Time AIoT Data Collection

**Content:**
This section discusses the real-time collection of AIoT (Artificial Intelligence of Things) data related to electricity usage.

#### 4.1. AIoT Sensors
- [Describe the sensors and devices used to collect electricity usage data in real-time.]

#### 4.2. Data Collection Frequency
- [hourly.]

#### 4.3. Data Storage
- [Explain where and how the collected data is stored for analysis.]
